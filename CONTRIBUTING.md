# ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

First of all, **thank you** for taking the time to contribute! We truly appreciate every contribution.

We welcome all contributions. Whether you're fixing typos, adding new resources, or suggesting improvements - it's all valuable!

To contribute, you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) 

**How GitHub Contributor Recognition Works:**

- GitHub's system automatically tracks contributors via **Pull Requests**
- To appear in the repository's [Contributors](https://github.com/PavelGrigoryevDS/awesome-data-analysis/graphs/contributors) list, you need to submit a PR
- Simple suggestions via Issues don't trigger automatic recognition

**Don't worry** - it's not difficult! We've created a visual guide below to help. 

While you can always just suggest resources via Issues and we'll add them, we welcome you to become an officially recognized contributor!
